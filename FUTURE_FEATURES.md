# Cursor History Explorer V2 - Feature Roadmap

This document outlines potential features and enhancements for the next version of the Cursor History Explorer. The features are grouped into tiers based on complexity and impact.

---

### Tier 1: Core Usability Improvements

These features focus on making the existing tool more accessible, user-friendly, and polished.

*   **1. Cross-Platform Support (The "Make it for Everyone" feature):**
    *   **What:** Add a settings option or input field to let users manually select their Cursor history folder.
    *   **Why:** This is the single most important feature to make the tool useful for developers on Windows or Linux, who have their history stored in a different place (e.g., `%APPDATA%`).

*   **2. Syntax Highlighting (The "Make it Pretty" feature):**
    *   **What:** In the content preview pane, automatically detect the language of the file (`.js`, `.css`, `.py`, etc.) and apply code highlighting.
    *   **Why:** It would make reviewing code files infinitely easier and more pleasant on the eyes. This would likely involve adding a library like `react-syntax-highlighter`.

*   **3. Copy to Clipboard (The "Simple & Sweet" feature):**
    *   **What:** Add a "Copy Content" button to the content preview pane.
    *   **Why:** A small but hugely convenient quality-of-life improvement for quickly grabbing code snippets without manual selection.

### Tier 2: Powerful New Capabilities

These features would significantly expand the core functionality of the application, turning it into a more powerful analysis tool.

*   **4. Version Diffing (The "Time Machine" feature):**
    *   **What:** Allow a user to select *two* versions of the same file. The content pane would then show a side-by-side or inline "diff," highlighting exactly what lines were added, changed, or removed.
    *   **Why:** This would elevate the application from just a recovery tool to a powerful code archaeology tool, letting you trace the evolution of a file.

*   **5. Content Search (The "Super Search" feature):**
    *   **What:** Add a new search mode or an advanced search panel to search *inside* the content of all the file versions, not just the filenames.
    *   **Why:** Incredibly useful if you remember a specific variable name, function, or line of code but can't remember which file it was in.

---

### Tier 3: Advanced "Pro" Features

These are more complex features that would provide a seamless, professional-grade experience.

*   **6. Direct Restore (The "One-Click Restore" feature):**
    *   **What:** Instead of just downloading a zip, add a "Restore to..." button. This would open a native folder picker and then automatically extract the selected files into that location, recreating the directory structure on the user's machine.
    *   **Why:** This would make the final step of the recovery process completely seamless. This is significantly more complex as it requires deeper interaction with the local file system, potentially via a backend agent or different browser APIs.

*   **7. Session Saving (The "Save my Spot" feature):**
    *   **What:** The ability to save your current view—including all your filter settings and your list of selected files—and load it again later. The session could be saved to local storage in the browser.
    *   **Why:** Perfect for large recovery projects where you might need to stop and start multiple times without losing your place.

### ✨ Future Enhancement Ideas (2024) ✨

#### Tier 1: Enhanced User Experience
* **1. Keyboard Shortcuts:**
  * **What:** Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions (e.g., `Ctrl+F` for search, `Ctrl+C` for copy, arrow keys for navigation)
  * **Why:** Power users can work more efficiently without reaching for the mouse

* **2. File Preview on Hover:**
  * **What:** Show a quick preview tooltip when hovering over files in the list
  * **Why:** Helps quickly identify content without full selection

* **3. Batch Operations:**
  * **What:** Add ability to perform operations on multiple selected files at once (restore, download, compare)
  * **Why:** More efficient when working with multiple related files

#### Tier 2: Advanced Features
* **4. Smart Grouping:**
  * **What:** Group related files by common patterns (e.g., test files with their implementation, related components)
  * **Why:** Makes it easier to restore or compare logically related files

* **5. Change Timeline:**
  * **What:** Visual timeline showing when changes occurred across selected files
  * **Why:** Better understand the sequence of changes and find specific points in time

* **6. Conflict Detection:**
  * **What:** When restoring files, detect if there are conflicts with existing files and offer resolution options
  * **Why:** Prevents accidental overwrites and data loss

#### Tier 3: Integration & Analysis
* **7. Git Integration:**
  * **What:** Compare history versions with Git versions, or optionally commit restored files directly
  * **Why:** Bridges the gap between history explorer and version control

* **8. Code Analysis:**
  * **What:** Analyze changes for potential issues (e.g., breaking changes, dependency updates)
  * **Why:** Helps make more informed decisions about which versions to restore

* **9. Export & Share:**
  * **What:** Generate shareable links or reports for specific files/versions
  * **Why:** Useful for team collaboration or documentation

* **10. Workspace Contexts:**
  * **What:** Save and switch between different workspace contexts (different projects/folders)
  * **Why:** Better organization for users working across multiple projects

These new features focus on enhancing productivity, adding safety measures, and enabling better collaboration while maintaining the tool's core simplicity.

### ✨ Additional Enhancement Ideas (2024 Q2) ✨

#### Expanding on Keyboard Navigation & Shortcuts
* **1. Custom Shortcut Mapping:**
  * **What:** Allow users to customize their keyboard shortcuts through a settings panel
  * **Why:** Different users have different preferences and muscle memory from other tools

* **2. Vim/Emacs Mode:**
  * **What:** Add optional Vim/Emacs keybindings for navigation and selection
  * **Why:** Power users often prefer these familiar and efficient navigation patterns

* **3. Command Palette:**
  * **What:** Add a command palette (like VS Code's Ctrl+Shift+P) that shows all available actions
  * **Why:** Makes it easy to discover and execute commands without memorizing shortcuts

#### Enhanced Conflict Resolution
* **4. Smart Merge:**
  * **What:** When conflicts are detected, provide an interactive three-way merge view (current, incoming, base)
  * **Why:** Makes it easier to resolve conflicts by seeing all versions side by side

* **5. Conflict Prevention:**
  * **What:** Add a "dry run" option that simulates a restore and shows potential conflicts before executing
