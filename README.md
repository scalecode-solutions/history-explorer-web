# History Explorer

A powerful web application for exploring and managing file history across multiple code editors. Built by Scalecode Solutions.

## üìñ The Origin Story

This project was born from a crisis and built in a whirlwind of collaborative coding. It's a testament to turning a data-loss disaster into a powerful, bespoke recovery tool.

The project began when a critical `resources` folder for a Titanium project was accidentally overwritten by an iCloud sync. Standard recovery methods failed, leaving the files seemingly lost forever.

The breakthrough came from an unconventional idea: searching the local history cache of the Cursor code editor, located at `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/History/`. This directory contained hashed folders, each representing a file, with `entries.json` mapping out its version history.

Our initial recovery was manual, using `grep` and `find` to locate specific files the user remembered. The key discovery was a common line of code (`var theme = require('/helpers/theme');`) that acted as a "fingerprint" to identify all the lost files. While successful, this process was slow and laborious. From this challenge, the History Explorer was born.

## üìñ Usage Guide

1. **Initial Setup**
   - On first launch, the app will automatically search for editor history directories
   - You can also manually specify a history directory path
   > ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The initial directory selection modal has some known layout issues that will be addressed in future releases.

2. **Navigation**
   - Use the directory tree to browse files
   - Filter files by extension using the dropdown
   - Search across all files using the search box
   - Use keyboard shortcuts for quick navigation

3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
   - `Ctrl/Cmd + F`: Focus search
   - `Ctrl/Cmd + /`: Focus directory filter
   - `Ctrl/Cmd + .`: Focus extension filter
   - Arrow keys: Navigate file list
   - Shift + Arrow keys: Multi-select files
   - Space: Toggle file selection
   - Escape: Clear selection

4. **File Operations**
   - View file versions and their timestamps
   - Compare different versions using the diff viewer
   - Export selected files as a ZIP archive
   - Restore files to their original locations
